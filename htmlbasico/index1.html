    <title> My Trip Around The USA on a Segway</title>

</head>

<body>
    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

    <p> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way:
        Walla Walla, WA
        Magic City, ID
        Bountiful, UT
        Last Chance, CO
        Truth or Consequences, NM
        Why, AZ</p>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today:
        Passing cars,
        When you can't see,
        May get you,
        A glimpse,
        Of eternity.

        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    <p> y first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        cellphone, iPod, digital camera and a protein bar

        Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a
        thousand miles begins with one Segway.</p>
